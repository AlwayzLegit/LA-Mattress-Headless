# Session handoff — 2026-05-04

## Where things stand

**Branch:** `claude/migrate-hydrogen-nextjs-O4Lo0`
**Last code commit:** `9b364e6` — "Phase 11: pre-Storefront wrap-up"
**Build state:** clean — `tsc --noEmit`, `next lint`, `next build` all pass.
**Live Storefront:** wired and verified (see "What got verified" below).

The Next.js side of the migration is structurally complete. All four URL
shapes from the brief — `/products`, `/collections`, `/pages`,
`/blogs/{blog}/{article}` — resolve. With a real Storefront token in
`.env.local`, `next build` SSGs **125 static pages**:

- 61 collection PLPs
- 33 published Shopify pages
- 14 priority PDPs
- 7 blog index pages
- 10 site-static pages (home, robots, sitemap, etc.)

Pages not in `generateStaticParams` (the other 181 PDPs, every blog
article) render dynamically with `dynamicParams = true` and cache via
`revalidate = 600`.

## What got verified end-to-end against the live store

I ran `npx next start` after a clean build and curl-tested:

| Route | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | 200, 116KB | Homepage renders w/ Org+LocalBusiness+WebSite JSON-LD |
| `/collections/mattresses` | 200, 171KB | PLP w/ filters + sort, real products |
| `/products/tempur-pedic-tempur-proadapt-medium-hybrid` | 200, 39KB | PDP, real variants |
| `/pages/koreatown-best-mattress-store` | 200, 53KB | Showroom override w/ FurnitureStore JSON-LD |
| `/pages/mattress-store-locations` | 200, 124KB | Locations index w/ 5-card directory + departments[] |
| `/blogs/sleep-blog` | 200, 88KB | Article grid, real articles flowing |
| `/search?q=tempur` | 200, 160KB | 20+ Tempur products returned |
| `/sleep-quiz` | 200, 37KB | Interactive matcher |
| `/opengraph-image` | 200, 49KB, image/png | Brand-themed OG card via next/og |
| `/collections/sale` (redirect) | 308 → `/collections/on-sale` | Redirects pipeline working |

Smoke test: Storefront `shop` query returned `LA Mattress Store`,
currency `USD`, primary domain `checkout.mattressstoreslosangeles.com`.

## .env.local

`.env.local` is gitignored. To recreate in the next session:

```bash
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=la-mattress.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PUBLIC_TOKEN=fa318d9ac6f847635e8ac3a31c41458b
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-10
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://mattressstoreslosangeles.com
```

The Storefront token is a Headless channel public access token (32-char
hex, no `shpat_` prefix). It's safe to expose to the browser but is
currently only used server-side via `lib/shopify/client.ts`.

> The user pasted an Admin API token (`shpat_4049…`) earlier in the
> conversation by mistake. **They should revoke that one** in Shopify
> Admin → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps → [their app] → API
> credentials. It was never used by the codebase, but it's been visible
> in the chat transcript.

## Known issues — to address next session

### 1. PDP and PLP return HTTP 200 (not 404) on bad handles — soft 404

**Symptom:** `/products/[bad-handle]` and `/collections/[bad-handle]`
render the 404 "Lost in the night" body but with HTTP 200 status. Bad
for SEO (Google may index missing handles as live 200 pages with thin
content).

**Status of other dynamic routes:**
- `/pages/[handle]` — 404 ✓
- `/blogs/[blog]` — 404 ✓
- `/blogs/[blog]/[article]` — **500** (DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE) ❌ — see
  issue #2 below

**Root cause (confirmed by isolation test):** route-level `loading.tsx`
wraps the route in a Suspense boundary. In Next.js 14.2.x, when
`notFound()` is thrown from inside a Suspense, the framework
sometimes serves the not-found body but loses the 404 status code.

PDP and PLP both have a `loading.tsx` (skeleton during navigation).
`/pages` and `/blogs` index don't. That's the differentiator.

**What was tried:**
- ✗ Calling `notFound()` from `generateMetadata` — no effect on
  PDP/PLP, broke article route to 500.
- ✗ Removing `revalidate = 600` from PDP — no effect.
- ✗ Adding route-segment `not-found.tsx` siblings — files compiled
  into the build, but Next.js still serves with 200. Kept anyway
  because they DO give route-specific 404 copy (better UX than the
  generic root not-found.tsx).
- ✗ Removing `loading.tsx` outright — confirmed cause but breaks
  navigation skeletons; also somehow broke real-handle PDP rendering
  in production mode (probably need to clear Vercel-style ISR cache).

**Recommended next-session approach:**
1. **Upgrade Next.js to 15.x** (`npm install next@latest react@latest`).
   The notFound() / Suspense interaction was reworked in Next 15. This
   is likely the cleanest fix and has the side benefit of unlocking
   `next/font/google` self-hosting for Geist (Phase 4b note).
2. If staying on Next 14: reimplement loading skeletons as a
   page-internal `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton/>}>` boundary around
   the data-fetch component, rather than route-level `loading.tsx`.
   The notFound() call would happen OUTSIDE the Suspense and emit the
   correct 404 status. Pattern:
   ```tsx
   export default async function ProductPage({ params }) {
     // Sync check up front: if handle isn't in our inventory snapshot,
     // 404 immediately. Note: misses recently-added products until we
     // re-run pull-inventory.mjs.
     if (!findProduct(params.handle)) notFound();
     return (
       <Suspense fallback={<ProductSkeleton/>}>
         <ProductBody handle={params.handle} />  {/* awaits Storefront */}
       </Suspense>
     );
   }
   ```

### 2. `/blogs/[blog]/[article]` returns 500 on bad article handles

**Symptom:** When the article handle doesn't exist (blog handle is
real, e.g. `/blogs/sleep-blog/no-such-article`), the route returns
HTTP 500 with a `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` digest in server logs.
`/blogs/[bad-blog]/anything` correctly 404s.

**Confirmed:** This was already broken before any of my fix attempts;
it's not a regression from the not-found.tsx work.

**Root cause (suspected):** the layout's `readCart()` calls
`cookies()`, which forces dynamic rendering. The article route's
`revalidate = 600` + `notFound()` + nested-dynamic-segment combo
(two dynamic params: `[blog]/[article]`) trips a known Next.js 14
edge case where the framework can't resolve "is this a not-found or
a forced-dynamic-due-to-cookies?" and surfaces the conflict as a
500.

**What was tried:**
- ✗ `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on the article route —
  made it WORSE (real articles also 500'd).

**Recommended next-session approach:** same as #1 — Next 15 upgrade
likely resolves this, OR refactor `readCart()` to not call cookies()
inline during layout render (e.g., move cart hydration to a client
component that fetches via a server action after mount).

## What's left before launch

**Operational (you do these):**
1. **Revoke the leaked Admin token** (see .env.local section).
2. **Run `node scripts/pull-inventory.mjs`** with an Admin token that
   has `read_content` + `read_themes` scopes. This populates:
   - Article handles per blog (currently empty in `data/url-inventory/blogs.json` — articles render dynamically until populated)
   - The full redirects table (currently 6 verified entries; brief estimates ~400 historical Shopify URL redirects)
3. **Visual QA in a real browser.** I built without a live browser.
   Expect cosmetic tweaks once you can see real Shopify product imagery
   in the layout. Probable suspects: hero, cart drawer line items,
   article cover ratios.
4. **Resolve the 404 status issue** (above).

**Vendor / content decision:**
- Live review feed (Birdeye / Yotpo) on PDP + homepage Reviews section
- Real account dashboard (currently a placeholder)
- Hero CMS metaobjects for editorial control of rotating slides

curl -sI http://localhost:3000/products/this-does-not-exist          # currently 200, should be 404 — start here
curl -sI http://localhost:3000/pages/this-does-not-exist              # 404 ✓
```
